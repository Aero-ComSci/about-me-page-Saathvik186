Throughout my whole life, I haven&rsquo;t been very self aware about what I will do in the future, but this school year, I gave the whole idea some thought. Until this school year, I never learned anything about what I would be interested in or want to do when I become an adult. I finally realized the business and entrepreneur pathway interests men and is cool. I would be good at something like this because of the mindset I constantly have to strive and be better than yesterday. Although I want to try this pathway, I am not completely sure as I haven&rsquo;t completely closed off other possible future pathways engineering. I also think engineering is a possible option for me since I find coding fun.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my whole life, I&rsquo;ve always been hard working whenever I was committed to doing or finding something, I wouldn&rsquo;t give up or find an answer to a solution if I haven&rsquo;t tried at all to solve or fix it. I&rsquo;ve never been one to take the easy way out of something since I think that doing that symbolizes the amount of effort you&rsquo;re willing to put into something. I&rsquo;ve also always been very strong about my opinion and persuading others to agree with me. When I feel strongly about something, I always find a way to back it up or prove to others. An example for both of these skills can be boy scouts, I have led many boy scout outings throughout my time that I&rsquo;ve been a boy scout. I went on multiple hikes, multiple bike rides, multiple camping trips, and multiple competitions as well. I&rsquo;ve lead multiple little scouts and showed them the ropes while also giving them advice on how to act like a proper scout</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my experiences in the past, I learned so much more about myself than everyone. By trying new things and finding new limits to my own abilities, I was able to learn more about what I liked and disliked. I learned new interests and abilities that I never knew I had. I learned many things like good habits and how to be happy with myself. I constantly improved myself every single day in order to become a better human being every single day. I use all my mistakes as a learning opportunity and try to never repeat them again. I stopped comparing myself to others and started comparing me to myself in order to fix what&rsquo;s wrong.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for a fact that I will be a better person in the future and I will learn a lot more things about myself. I think when people get to know me very well, it also helps them become a better person. Everyone should view my website for this class to learn more about me and my habits</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sincerely,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saathvik Aluri</span></p></body></html>
